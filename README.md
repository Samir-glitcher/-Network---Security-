# -Network---Security-
This repository tracks my learning progress in network security, packet analysis, IDS/IPS, and cybersecurity labs.


#### In this journey of mastering Network - Security, there are multiple terms that I should learn as well as practice. Some of the terms could be familiar where as some might be completely stranger to me. But I will make sure to put my hands on each of the important terms that are needed for a secure network environment.


 ## What is wireshark?
 
 
 
 
 -Wireshark is a (network packet analyzer).
                      
                      -A network packet analyzer presents captured packet data in as much detail as possible.


## Learning about interface and tools. 
- Studying the functions of different user interface, such as: File, Edit, View, Go, Capture, Analyze, Statistics, Telephony, Wireless, Tools and Help.   (At the same time, it is a plus point to remember various shortcut keys, as it makes the whole process easier.)

After learning about all the user interface terms, now its finally turn for next step. That is:

## Capturing Live Network Data
- During my learning phase, I noticed these are some of the things that you should consider before capturing:

   - You may need special privileges to start a live capture.
   - You need to choose the right network interface to capture packet data from.
   - You need to capture at the right place in the network to see the traffic you want to see.


  So keep in mind that you figure these basic things out so it doesn't ruin your future capturing experience.



- The native capture file formats used by Wireshark are:

pcap. The default format used by the libpcap packet capture library. Used by tcpdump, _Snort, Nmap, Ntop, and many other tools.

pcapng. A flexible, extensible successor to the pcap format. Wireshark 1.8 and later save files as pcapng by default. Versions prior to 1.8 used pcap. Used by Wireshark and by tcpdump in newer versions of macOS.
